Well there are two ways to use this:

1º this is ruby if you have ruby installed and the following gems you are ready to go:

	list of gems:
		win32ole
		sqlite3
		nokogiri

	sql_to_datafile.rb config.xml

2º this is cool if you dont want to install ruby in your machine

First get a machine with ruby, then install folowing gems win32ole, sqlite3, sqlite3, nokogiri and ocra. 

The last gem (OCRA) is a "compiles" all the code and depencies in one file so that you dont need anything mode then that to work.

class path list:
	class/*.rb
	class/database/*.rb 
	class/log/*.rb 
	class/ntec/*.rb 
	class/write_to/*.rb 
	class/xml/*.rb

commands:
	ocra sql_to_datafile.rb class/*.rb class/database/*.rb class/log/*.rb class/ntec/*.rb class/write_to/*.rb class/xml/*.rb  --icon buzz.ico
